You‚Äôre ready to create a dashboard.

A dashboard is your go-to tool for communicating insights about a particular set of data. 
But, to build a great dashboard‚Äîa truly informative and actionable dashboard‚Äîit takes more 
than just putting all of your insights onto a canvas.

There are planning and design elements that must be deliberately accounted for in order to 
give a dashboard the most bang for your buck.
